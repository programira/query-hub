INSTRUCTIONS:

- The goal of this exercise is to test your skills with basic React components, and React composition.
- Given a list of questions, the App should render them in a list, and the user should be given a choice of whether or not to reveal the answer.
- Start the assignment by going to file src/components/1_Notification.tsx, and follow the instructions from there.
- We don' expect you to focus too much on the styling/css part, but feel free to showcase your css skills if you feel like it :)

You can add tests as you see fit, in this assignment we are using React testing library:
